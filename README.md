<h1> Linux Server Practice </h1>

This is a practice to launch a web app on a Linux server on a Cloud. 




<h2>Used software/services </h2>
<p> - Flask for backend web application
<p> - PostgreSQL for the database 
<p> - sqlalchemy to access to the database
<p> - Google OAuth for thrid party authentification
<p> - Apache2 for webserver
<p> - Amazon AWS (Lightsail) for hosting


<h2>SSH login</h2> 
<p> - IP address and SSH port for the server:  54.93.241.240,  SSH port 2200     
<p> - To access, it is required to have a user name and secret key, that are provided by me
<p> - The shell command is as following =>  "ssh -i SECRETKEY_FILE_PATH USERNAME@54.93.241.240 -p 2200" 
<p> - Sometimes the server is stopped to save the cost. In that case, please contact to me


<h2>Web acccess</h2>
<p> - URL of the web application:  <a href="http://54.93.241.240.xip.io">54.93.241.240.xip.io</a>   (using xip.io becaues Google AOuth does not allow number-only url) 
<p> - By accessing that address from your browser, you can see the website
