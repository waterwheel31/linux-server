Linux Server Practice

This is a practice to launch a web app on a Linux server on a Cloud. 

Used software/services 
- Flask for backend web application
- PostgreSQL for the database 
- sqlalchemy to access to the database
- Google OAuth for thrid party authentification
- Apache2 for webserver
- Amazon AWS (Lightsail) for hosting


SSH login 
- IP address and SSH port for the server:  54.93.241.240,  SSH port 2200     
- To access, it is required to have a user name and secret key, that are provided by me


Web cccess
- URL of the web application:  54.93.241.240.xip.io   (using xip.io becaues Google AOuth does not allow number-only url) 
- By accessing that address from your browser, you can see the website
